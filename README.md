# TextAdventure
This is a text adventure game made with c++

In this adventure, the player will be able to face 3 different types of enemies, be able to use items such as potions (+50 health), go through 10 rooms with different possible routes, face a final boss and be confused by some errors due to the lack of accents in the Visual Studio console (sorry about that).

The game is in Spanish, however both the code and the comments are implemented in English, to make it easier for the public to understand.

To play the game it is only necessary to read the instructions. 
Apart from entering the name, the player only has to press the keys from 1 to 4, depending on the actions he/she wants to take. Simple, isn't it?
